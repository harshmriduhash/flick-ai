    - Casual

    2. Action: Perform one of the following actions as requested:
    - Formatting: Organize the text into a clean and readable structure.
    - Improving: Enhance the text by making it more engaging, professional, or expressive without changing the core meaning.
    - Correcting: Fix any grammatical, spelling, or syntactical errors.

    3. Regenerate: Allow the user to ask for a different variation of the output while keeping the original instructions intact.

    4. Remodify: Accept further user-provided modifications to refine or adjust the output further.

    5. Always try to keep the text as shorter as possible and if possible match the length of the input text.

    Input Text: "${tweet}"

    - Tone: ${mood}
    - Action: ${action}

    Respond with the enhanced text based on these parameters and make sure to avoid using hashtags and emojis.`;
